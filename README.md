## About

This is an implementation of Common Lisp dynamic variables, control flow operators, and condition system in plain Java.

It started out as a proof that a condition system can be implemented even on top of a language that has only automatic memory management and a primitive unwinding operator (`throw`), but does not have dynamic variables or non-local returns by default.

It should be possible to use it, or parts of it, in other projects, and its source code should be readable enough to understand the underlying mechanics of each Lisp control flow operator.

## Using Cafe Latte

This library is not yet documented, but the respective implementations should behave analogously to their Common Lisp counterparts; see the [Common Lisp HyperSpec](http://clhs.lisp.se/) for their descriptions.

Example uses of the various constructs [implemented](src/main/java/systems/raptor/cafe_latte) here are present in the [test directory](src/test/java/systems/raptor/cafe_latte), containing unit tests for all the present mechanisms.

A stable release of this library will be made when the authors are satisfied enough with its functioning.

## What's DONE

* [X] **Dynamic variables**
  * [X] Dynamic variable class
    * Implemented in the `DynamicVariable` class.
    * Unit tests done.
* [X] **Control flow**
  * [X] `tagbody`/`go`
    * Implemented in the `Tagbody` class.
    * Unit tests done.
  * [X] `block`/`return-from`
    * Implemented in the `Block` class.
    * Unit tests done.
  * [X] `throw`/`catch`
    * Because of Java naming conflicts, `catch`/`throw` are renamed to `grasp`/`fling`.
    * Implemented in the `Grasp` class.
    * Unit tests done.
    * `throw`/`catch` are not required for implementing a condition system, but their implementations are nonetheless included here for completeness.
* [X] **Conditions**
  * [X] Condition class
    * Implemented in the `Condtion` class.
    * Subtype of `RuntimeException`.
    * Do not fill in the stack trace when instantiated; see the `superFillInStackTrace()` method.
  * [X] Warning class
    * Implemented in the `Warning` class.
    * Subtype of `Condition`.
  * [X] Error class
    * Implemented in the `Error` class.
    * Subtype of `Condition`.

  * [X] Handler class
    * Implemented in the `Handler` class.
    * Tested elsewhere.
  * [X] `signal`
    * Implemented in the `Handler` class as a static method.
    * Tested elsewhere.
  * [X] `warn`
    * Implemented in the `Handler` class as a static method.
    * Unit tests done.
  * [X] `error`
    * Implemented in the `Handler` class as a static method.
    * Unit tests done.
  * [X] `handler-bind`
    * Implemented in the `HandlerBind` class.
    * Unit tests done.
  * [X] `handler-case`
    * Implemented in the `HandlerCase` class.
    * Unit tests done.
  * [X] `ignore-errors`
    * Implemented in the `HandlerCase` class as a static method.
    * Unit tests done.
* [X] **Restarts**
  * [X] Restart class
    * Implemented in the `Restart` class.
    * Unit tests done.
  * [X] `restart-bind`
    * Implemented in the `RestartBind` class.
    * Unit tests done.
  * [X] `restart-case`
    * Implemented in the `RestartCase` class.
    * Unit tests done.
  * [X] `with-simple-restart`
    * Implemented in the `RestartCase` class as a static method.
    * Unit tests done.
* [X] **Debugger**
  * [X] Debugger interface
    * Defined in the `Debugger` class.
  * [X] No debugger
    * Implemented in the `NoDebugger` class.
    * Tested along with the `Error` class by means of calling the static `error` method.

## What's TODO

* [ ] `*debugger-hook*`
* [ ] `break`
* [ ] `*break-on-signals*`
* [ ] Interactive debugger
* [ ] JShell as debugger REPL

## What's WONTDO

* [X] `unwind-protect` - Java has `finally` that is fully equivalent.
